# astro-provider-ray

This repository provides a set of tools for integrating [Apache Airflow®](https://airflow.apache.org/) with Ray, enabling the orchestration of Ray jobs within Airflow workflows. It includes a decorator, two operators, and one trigger designed to efficiently manage and monitor Ray jobs and services.

### Components

#### Hooks
- **RayHook**: This hook is used to setup the methods needed to run the operators. It works in the background along with the connection of type 'Ray' to setup & delete ray clusters and also submit Ray jobs to existing clusters

#### Decorators
- **_RayDecoratedOperator**: This decorator allows you to submit a job to a Ray cluster. It simplifies the integration process by decorating your task functions to work seamlessly with Ray.

#### Operators

- **SetupRayCluster**: Placeholder -- write details on cluster setup
- **DeleteRayCluster**: Placeholder -- write details on cluster deletion
- **SubmitRayJob**: This operator is used to submit a job to a Ray cluster using a specified host name. It facilitates scheduling Ray jobs to execute at defined intervals.

#### Triggers
- **RayJobTrigger**: This trigger monitors the status of asynchronous jobs submitted via the `SubmitRayJob` operator. It ensures that the Airflow task waits until the job is completed before proceeding with the next step in the DAG.

### Compatibility

These operators have been tested with the below versions. They will most likely be compatible with future versions but have not yet been tested.

| Python Version | Airflow Version | Ray Version |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 3.11           | 2.9.0           | 2.23.0      |


### Example Usage

Before using the astro-provider-ray, you need to set up a few things:

#### 1. Setting up the connection

To use this provider, you need to set up a connection in Airflow. The fields you need to fill depend on which operators you plan to use:

1. Go to the Airflow UI and navigate to Admin -> Connections.
2. Click on "Create" to add a new connection.
3. Set the Connection Type to "Ray".

##### For SubmitRayJob operator (using an existing Ray cluster):

If you already have a Ray cluster and want to submit jobs to it, fill in these fields:

- Connection ID: A unique identifier for this connection (e.g., "ray_conn")
- Ray dashboard url : The URL of the Ray dashboard
- Create cluster if needed: Leave unchecked
- Cookies: Any cookies required for authentication (optional)
- Metadata: Any additional metadata (optional)
- Headers: Any additional headers (optional)
- Verify: Check this box to verify SSL certificates

##### For SetupRayCluster and DeleteRayCluster operators:

If you want to set up or delete Ray clusters on Kubernetes, you need to provide Kubernetes configuration. Fill in these fields:

- Connection ID: A unique identifier for this connection (e.g., "ray_k8s_conn")
- Kube config path: Path to your kubeconfig file
  OR
- Kube config: Paste your kubeconfig content in JSON format
- Namespace: The Kubernetes namespace to use (optional, defaults to "default")
- Cluster context: The Kubernetes cluster context to use (optional)
- Disable SSL: Check this box to disable SSL verification (if needed)
- Disable TCP keepalive: Check this box to disable TCP keepalive (if needed)

**Note:** The `kube_config_path` and `kube_config` options are mutually exclusive. You can only use one at a time.

After setting up the appropriate connection, you can use it in your DAGs by referencing the Connection ID you specified. Make sure to use the correct connection ID based on the operators you're using in your DAG.

#### 2. Setting up the Ray cluster spec

For the `SetupRayCluster` and `DeleteRayCluster` operators, you need to provide a Ray cluster specification. This is typically a YAML file that defines the configuration of your Ray cluster. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
# ray.yaml
apiVersion: ray.io/v1
kind: RayCluster
metadata:
  name: raycluster-complete
spec:
  rayVersion: "2.10.0"
  enableInTreeAutoscaling: true
  headGroupSpec:
    serviceType: LoadBalancer
    rayStartParams:
      dashboard-host: "0.0.0.0"
      block: "true"
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          ray-node-type: head
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: ray-head
          image: rayproject/ray-ml:latest
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 4
              memory: 8Gi
            requests:
              cpu: 4
              memory: 8Gi
          lifecycle:
            preStop:
              exec:
                command: ["/bin/sh","-c","ray stop"]
          ports:
          - containerPort: 6379
            name: gcs
          - containerPort: 8265
            name: dashboard
          - containerPort: 10001
            name: client
          - containerPort: 8000
            name: serve
          - containerPort: 8080
            name: metrics
  workerGroupSpecs:
  - groupName: small-group
    replicas: 2
    minReplicas: 2
    maxReplicas: 5
    rayStartParams:
      block: "true"
    template:
      metadata:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: machine-learning
          image: rayproject/ray-ml:latest
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 2
              memory: 4Gi
            requests:
              cpu: 2
              memory: 4Gi
```
Save this file in a location accessible to your Airflow installation, and reference it in your DAG code.

**Note:** `spec.headGroupSpec.serviceType` must be a 'LoadBalancer' to spin a service that exposes your dashboard

#### 3. Code Samples

There are two main scenarios for using this provider:

##### Scenario 1: Setting up a Ray cluster on an existing Kubernetes cluster

If you have an existing Kubernetes cluster and want to install a Ray cluster on it, then run a Ray job, you can use the `SetupRayCluster`, `SubmitRayJob`, and `DeleteRayCluster` operators. Here's an example DAG (`setup_teardown.py`):

The provided `setup_teardown.py` script demonstrates how to configure and use the `SetupRayCluster`, `DeleteRayCluster` and the `SubmitRayJob` operators within an Airflow DAG:

```python
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ray_provider.operators.ray import SetupRayCluster, DeleteRayCluster, SubmitRayJob

default_args = {
    "owner": "airflow",
    "start_date": datetime(2024, 3, 26),
    "retries": 1,
    "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=0),
}

RAY_SPEC = "/usr/local/airflow/dags/scripts/ray.yaml"
RAY_RUNTIME_ENV = {"working_dir": "/usr/local/airflow/example_dags/ray_scripts"}

dag = DAG(
    "Setup_Teardown",
    default_args=default_args,
    description="Setup Ray cluster and submit a job",
    schedule_interval=None,
)

setup_cluster = SetupRayCluster(
    task_id="SetupRayCluster",
    conn_id="ray_conn",
    ray_cluster_yaml=RAY_SPEC,
    use_gpu=False,
    update_if_exists=False,
    dag=dag,
)

submit_ray_job = SubmitRayJob(
    task_id="SubmitRayJob",
    conn_id="ray_conn",
    entrypoint="python script.py",
    runtime_env=RAY_RUNTIME_ENV,
    num_cpus=1,
    num_gpus=0,
    memory=0,
    resources={},
    fetch_logs=True,
    wait_for_completion=True,
    job_timeout_seconds=600,
    xcom_task_key="SetupRayCluster.dashboard",
    poll_interval=5,
    dag=dag,
)

delete_cluster = DeleteRayCluster(
    task_id="DeleteRayCluster",
    conn_id="ray_conn",
    ray_cluster_yaml=RAY_SPEC,
    use_gpu=False,
    dag=dag,
)

# Create ray cluster and submit ray job
setup_cluster.as_setup() >> submit_ray_job >> delete_cluster.as_teardown()
setup_cluster >> delete_cluster
```

##### Scenario 2: Using an existing Ray cluster

If you already have a Ray cluster set up, you can use the Ray Taskflow API to submit jobs directly. Here's an example DAG (`ray_taskflow_example.py`):

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag, task as airflow_task
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from ray_provider.decorators.ray import task

RAY_TASK_CONFIG = {
    "conn_id": "ray_conn",
    "runtime_env": {
        "working_dir": "/usr/local/airflow/dags/ray_scripts",
        "pip": ["numpy"],
    },
    "num_cpus": 1,
    "num_gpus": 0,
    "memory": 0,
    "poll_interval": 5,
}


@dag(
    dag_id="ray_taskflow_example",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
    catchup=False,
    default_args={
        "owner": "airflow",
        "retries": 1,
        "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5),
    },
    tags=["ray", "example"],
)
def ray_taskflow_dag():

    @airflow_task
    def generate_data():
        import numpy as np

        return np.random.rand(100).tolist()

    @task.ray(config=RAY_TASK_CONFIG)
    def process_data_with_ray(data):
        import ray
        import numpy as np

        @ray.remote
        def square(x):
            return x**2

        ray.init()
        data = np.array(data)
        futures = [square.remote(x) for x in data]
        results = ray.get(futures)
        mean = np.mean(results)
        print(f"Mean of squared values: {mean}")
        return mean

    data = generate_data()
    process_data_with_ray(data)


ray_example_dag = ray_taskflow_dag()
```
In this example, the `@task.ray` decorator is used to define a task that will be executed on the Ray cluster.
Remember to adjust file paths, connection IDs, and other specifics according to your setup.
